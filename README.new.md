# react-redux-confirm

Small library for managing re-usable confirm dialog state. This does not provide any kind of view component, rather it provides a HOC that lets you use your own modal.

## Motivation / Goals

React and redux both simplify a lot of problems. However, creating and managing something simple like a confirmation modal is still one of those things that takes a disproportianate amount of code to accomplish something trivial. Hopefully this module can cut down on that.
